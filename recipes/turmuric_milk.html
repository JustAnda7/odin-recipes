    <p>I found many drink recipes calling for milk, turmeric, and ginger root.
        I sampled different amounts of each ingredient and feel this is a perfect balance between creamy almond milk, spicy ginger, and the earthy taste of turmeric. 
        This is a less spiced version of Haldi Ka Doodh.</p>
    <ul><h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <li>1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh turmeric root, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h4>Steps</h4>
        <li>Combine turmeric root, ginger root, and honey together in a bowl, crushing the turmeric and ginger as much as possible.</li>
        <li>Heat almond milk in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Once small bubbles begin to form around the edges, reduce heat to low. Transfer about 2 tablespoon milk to turmeric mixture to allow mixture to soften and honey to melt into a paste-like mixture. </li>
        <li>Mix the turmeric paste into milk in the saucepan; raise temperature to medium-low and cook, stirring continuously, until fully combined. Blend with an immersion blender for a smooth texture. </li>
        <li>Pour turmeric tea into a mug and top with ground turmeric and cinnamon. </li>
    </ol>
